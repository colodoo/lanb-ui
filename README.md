FE common components &amp;&amp; base on Vue.js

> A interactively, selectable, UI framework lanb-ui

[中文文档](./README-zh.md)

## Features

### Interactively

This framework focuses more on the **interaction** between users and components, and you can find any underlying component you want unless it hasn't been created yet.

### Selectable

More interactive features mean more choices in design, and if you're not satisfied with the default style, you can write your own style components, which retain basic functionality and just switch styles.
